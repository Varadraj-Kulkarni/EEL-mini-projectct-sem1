  <section id="about">
    <h2>About</h2>
    <p>Earthquake detection systems are networks of sensors that monitor seismic activity across regions. They continuously analyze ground motion, providing early warnings that can save lives and minimize damage. These systems are used by scientists, governments, and disaster management agencies to better prepare and respond to seismic threats.</p>
    <p>Modern earthquake detection combines hardware (like accelerometers and seismometers) with software algorithms that interpret wave patterns in real time. This integration allows warnings to be sent seconds before the shaking reaches populated areas, offering a crucial window for safety measures.</p>

  <section id="how-it-works">
    <h2>How It Works</h2>
    <p>Seismic sensors are deployed underground to detect the first tremors (P-waves) generated by earthquakes. These waves travel faster than the destructive S-waves that cause most of the shaking. When sensors detect unusual vibrations, data is instantly sent to centralized monitoring systems for analysis.</p>
    <p>Machine learning algorithms and AI models now play a big role in distinguishing genuine seismic events from false alarms caused by construction or traffic. Once verified, alerts are sent through communication channels such as mobile networks, sirens, and public broadcasts—helping people respond quickly.</p>

    <h2>Safety Tips</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Stay calm:</strong> Avoid panicking. Clear thinking helps you make safe decisions.</li>
      <li><strong>Drop, Cover, and Hold On:</strong> Drop to the ground, take cover under sturdy furniture, and hold on until shaking stops.</li>
      <li><strong>Stay indoors:</strong> Move away from windows, mirrors, and heavy furniture that could fall.</li>
      <li><strong>After shaking stops:</strong> Evacuate calmly, check for injuries, and assist others if safe to do so.</li>
      <li><strong>Have a safety kit ready:</strong> Keep essentials like water, first aid, flashlight, and important documents accessible.</li>
      <li><strong>Stay informed:</strong> Follow local news and emergency alerts for updates on aftershocks and evacuation plans.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>About the Project</h2>
    <p>This project is developed by our team to promote awareness about earthquake detection and safety practices. We aim to highlight how technology, education, and community preparedness can work together to reduce disaster impact.</p>
    <p>Our team collaborated on researching global early-warning systems, studying real-world earthquake events, and understanding the challenges faced by seismologists. This website serves as an educational resource for students, emergency planners, and the public.</p>
    <p>We believe that knowledge is the first step toward safety — understanding how detection works empowers individuals and communities to act swiftly and confidently during emergencies.</p>

  <section id="future">
    <h2>Future Developments</h2>
    <p>The future of earthquake detection lies in the integration of artificial intelligence, satellite data, and community-based networks. As computing power grows, predictive models may one day forecast seismic events more accurately, giving populations even more time to prepare.</p>
    <p>Innovations such as IoT-based sensors, real-time crowd-sourced data, and early-warning mobile apps are already revolutionizing disaster management. Collaboration between scientists, governments, and tech companies continues to advance this critical field — bringing us closer to a safer and more resilient world.</p>
