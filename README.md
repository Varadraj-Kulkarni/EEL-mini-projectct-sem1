1. Overview
This website provides live earthquake data, educational content, and safety guidelines focused on the Indian subcontinent. The purpose is to help students, citizens, and emergency planners understand how earthquakes are detected, how early-warning systems function, and how to stay safe before, during, and after seismic events.
It combines real-time data, informational articles, and visual elements such as illustrations and diagrams to enhance public awareness.

2. Live Earthquake Data (USGS)
The homepage displays the most recent earthquakes detected by the United States Geological Survey (USGS) in and around India, Bangladesh, Nepal, and nearby regions.
Each entry includes:
●	Location

●	Magnitude

●	Date and Time

●	Warnings for strong earthquakes

Example Entries
●	23 km NNE of Tungi, Bangladesh
 Magnitude: 4
 Time: November 27, 2025 – 03:45 PM

●	11 km W of Narsingdi, Bangladesh
 Magnitude: 4.3
 Time: November 22, 2025 – 05:36 PM

●	14 km SSW of Narsingdi, Bangladesh
 Magnitude: 5.4 ⚠️ (Warning – strong shaking)
 Time: November 21, 2025 – 10:08 AM

●	Western Xizang (Tibet region)
 Magnitude: 4.2
 Time: November 18, 2025 – 09:45 AM

●	84 km NE of Lobuche, Nepal
 Magnitude: 4.7
 Time: November 4, 2025 – 02:27 AM

The data informs users about recent seismic activity and helps people stay prepared.


3. About Earthquake Detection Systems
This section explains how real-world earthquake monitoring works.
Key Points
●	Earthquake detection uses a network of seismic sensors placed underground.

●	These sensors detect P-waves, which travel faster than destructive S-waves.

●	Real-time analysis is used to identify whether the motion is actually an earthquake or a false alarm.

●	Data is processed by:

○	Seismometers

○	Accelerometers

○	Real-time software

○	Artificial intelligence models

Modern systems allow authorities to issue alerts seconds before shaking begins, which can save lives and reduce damage.
  

4. How the System Works
The website explains the process in a simple 4-step format:
Step 1: Detection
Sensors sense the initial tremors underground.
Step 2: Transmission
The signal is instantly sent to monitoring centers.
Step 3: Analysis
Algorithms and AI models confirm whether the tremor is a real earthquake.
Step 4: Alerts
If verified, warnings are sent through:
●	Mobile notifications

●	Sirens

●	Broadcasting systems

●	Online platforms

This early-warning window may be just a few seconds, but it is enough to take protective action.
 
5. Safety Tips
The website provides practical steps everyone should follow during an earthquake.
Essential Safety Rules
●	Stay calm — panic causes mistakes.

●	Drop, Cover, and Hold On under sturdy furniture.

●	Stay away from windows, glass, and tall objects.

●	Stay indoors until shaking stops.

●	After the quake:

○	Evacuate if necessary.

○	Help others if it is safe.

○	Check for structural damage.

Emergency Kit Items
●	Drinking water

●	First aid supplies

●	Flashlight

●	Important documents

●	Emergency contact list
